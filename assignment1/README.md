# Speech Synthesis ðŸ¦œ
You are asked to synthesize some vowels (monophthongs) using the source-filter model of speech production. The process involves:
- Estimating the formant structure of each vowel directly from a real speech sample, using linear predictive coding (LPC)
- Generating synthesized vowels by passing a periodic impulse train through the all-pole filter obtained

## Directory Layout
The helper functions can be found in the `assignment_1` directory. All the files ending in `.m` are MATLAB functions and the actual speech synthesis and analysis is done in the `speech_synthesis.mlx` file.

The `speech` directory contains the audio files used in the assignment. The `synthesized_impulse` and `synthesized_sawtooth` directories contain the synthesized audio files.
